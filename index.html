    <h1>Welcome to my page about Lorem Ipsum!</h1>

    <h2>Lorem ipsum </h2>
    <h3>What is lorem ipsum?</h3>
    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
        a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
        of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <h3>Where do I use lorem ipsum?</h3>
    <p>
        Wherever you need filler text! You can also change it up by using something like
        <a href="https://cupcakeipsum.com/" target="_blank">cupcake ipsum</a> or
        <a href="https://pirateipsum.me/" target="_blank">pirate ipsum</a>!
    </p>
    <p>If we quick ipsum, you can also use <code>lorem+tab</code> in VS Code, as shown here:</p>
    <img src="./vscode-lorem.png" alt="Lorem ipsum shortcut in VS Code" width="600" />
    <p>
        This results in the following:
        <br>
        Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Pariatur consequuntur numquam saepe aliquid, sequi
        quis dicta architecto officiis esse suscipit illo, quasi delectus est minima nobis id harum eveniet obcaecati.
    </p>

    <h2>Lorem Picsum</h2>
    <p>You can also use random images from picsum, a play on the name Lorem Ipsum and Pictures</p>
